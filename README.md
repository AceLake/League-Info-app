# League-Info-app
This app serves as a proof of concept, exploring my ability to develop an ASP .NET Core web application that can effectively consume third-party APIs.

## Abstract
As I progressed through my classes, we delved into creating our own REST APIs. This experience sparked my curiosity about harnessing the data generated by APIs from other applications. Unfortunately being an avid player of the game League of Legends, I was particularly thrilled to discover that Riot Games, the creator of League, provides free access to their APIs. This opened up exciting possibilities for me to integrate their data into my project.
